# Offline-first App Example

This is an exaple to show a simple offline-first App.

It shows the stock of different bicycles in a bicycle shop.

The values get red when the data could not be updated to the mysql remote database. The values in green mean that stock data is updated to mysql remote database.

You can play enabling and disabling the mysql service to check the functionality.

Here I show a screenshot showing the info saved indexedDB where the field "updated=true" means that info should be updated next time the server is available.
